        <h2>WE HAD AN AMUSEMENT PARK?</h2>
        <image src="../img/idora-park.jpg" alt="Idora Park, aerial view. Features a density of amusement park rides and rollercoasters, with the East Bay hills in the background." style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0px;"></image>
        <p>It‚Äôs true! The area between 56th and 58th St (Idora Park / where the cute little storybook houses are) used to be a huge amusement park with rides like the ‚ÄúBarrel of Fun‚Äù and a Pennsylvania coal mining exhibit . Over 2M people would visit each year.</p>
        <p>It was eventually razed to the ground in 1929, hit by economic woes and the removal of streetcar lines in the area. (More pictures are online @ <a href="https://www.theflyer.org" target="_blank">www.theflyer.org</a>.)</p>

        <h2>EVEN MORE PARK CONVERSATIONS!</h2>
        <p>Sometime in the middle of last month I dragged a couple chairs, a box of pizza, and some watermelon to the park to hang out and talk about the park! I got a lot of responses on the survey (responses are here), but I had truly zero idea how many people would show up.</p>
        <img src="../img/park-meetup-01.jpg" alt="A neighbor speaking with a child about what they'd like to see in Bushrod Park. They are pointing at a sign with other suggestions." style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 20px 0px;"></img>
        <p>Thankfully, I was not alone by any means. Three neighbors (most of whom had never met before) sat and chatted for a few hours about our personal histories, our local environment, the abandoned school building, and more. A couple other neighbors in the park popped by to join in every now and then.</p>
        <p>From both that lovely conversation and the survey results (left QR code), there‚Äôs a lot we could do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>There is a lot that we all agree would improve the park right now,</b> like a better playground or just cleaning up trash. K & J are thinking about hosting a cleanup day soon; send me a note if you‚Äôre into that and let‚Äôs make it happen!</li>
            <li><b>We have to treat the park's environment with care.</b> Did you know the park is an important roosting site for some local birds? Or that J has been patching up the parts of the field that have eroded away? I did not!</li>
            <li><b>Dogs are loved, but we agreed the park is for people first and foremost.</b> We can do better to make sure the park is clean, kids are safe, and athletes can practice undisturbed. Good ideas came up to manage that better.</li>
            <li><b>The abandoned building (a preschool, apparently) on the NE corner is an opportunity.</b> It would be complicated and expensive to clean it up and transfer the property, but that site could be much more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Anyway, lots to talk about! The councilmember‚Äôs office is interested in helping improve the park too, so I‚Äôm thinking of organizing another park conversation.

        <h2>NEIGHBORHOOD SNAPSHOTS</h2>
        <p>Just a few wholesome snapshots in the neighborhood from the last few days:</p>

        <p>Lovely neighbor decided to take it upon themselves to repaint the sign! Thank you!  üå∏</p>
